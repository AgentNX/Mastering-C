## Definition

In C, **constants** refer to fixed values that do not change during program execution. **Literals** are the actual values that are assigned to variables or constants in the code.

## Purpose

- **Constants**: Provide fixed values that remain unchanged throughout the execution of a program, helping to maintain consistency and prevent accidental modification.
- **Literals**: Represent specific data values in the source code, such as numbers, characters, or strings.

## Types of Constants

1. **Integer Constants**:
  - Whole numbers without a decimal point.
  - Can be written in **decimal, octal, or hexadecimal** formats.
    - **Decimal**: `123`, `-45`
    - **Octal**: `0123` (starts with 0)
    - **Hexadecimal**: `0x1A` (starts with 0x)
### Example
```bash
int num1 = 100;    // Decimal
int num2 = 0123;   // Octal (83 in decimal)
int num3 = 0x1A;   // Hexadecimal (26 in decimal)
```

2. **Floating-point Constants**:
  - Numbers with a decimal point.
  - Can be written in regular or scientific notation.
### Example
```bash
float pi = 3.14;
double e = 2.71828;
float scientific = 1.2e3; // 1.2 * 10^3 = 1200.0
```

3. **Character Constants**:
  - Single characters enclosed in single quotes (`' '`).
  - Can also represent escape sequences like `\n`, `\t`, etc.
### Example
```bash
char letter = 'A';
char newline = '\n'; // Represents a newline character
```

4. **String Constants (String Literals)**:
  - Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (`" "`).
### Example
```bash
char greeting[] = "Hello, World!";
```

5. **Boolean Constants (C99)**:
  - In C99 and later, `_Bool` type constants represent `true` (1) and `false` (0).
### Example
```bash
_Bool isActive = 1; // true
```

## Types of Literals

1. **Integer Literals**:
  - Represent numeric values without fractional parts.
  - Examples: `10`, `-200`, `0xFF` (Hexadecimal), `075` (Octal).
2. **Floating-point Literals**:
  - Represent real numbers with decimals.
  - Examples: `3.14`, `-2.718`, `1.2e5`.
3. **Character Literals**:
  - Represent individual characters in single quotes.
  - Examples: `'a'`, `'1'`, `'\n'` (new line).
4. **String Literals**:
  - Represent sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.
  - Examples: `"Hello"`, `"C Programming"`, `"1234"`.

## Constants in C (Using `#define`)

Constants can also be defined using the `#define` preprocessor directive. These are replaced by their values at compile time.

### Example
```bash
#define PI 3.14159
#define MAX_LENGTH 100

int main() {
    float area = PI * 5 * 5; // Using the constant PI
    char name[MAX_LENGTH];   // Using the constant MAX_LENGTH
}
```

## Advantages of Using Constants

1. **Readability**: Using meaningful constant names improves code clarity (e.g., `MAX_SPEED` instead of `100`).
2. **Maintainability**: Changing a constant in one place (e.g., `#define PI 3.14`) will automatically update the entire program.
3. **Prevents Errors**: Prevents accidental modification of fixed values in the program.

## Key Points

- **Literals** are the actual data values written directly in the code (e.g., `5`, `'A'`).
- **Constants** are values that are fixed and do not change, declared using `#define` or `const`.
- **Character constants** and **string literals** are used for characters and strings, respectively.
- Use constants to improve code maintainability, readability, and safety.

## Example: Program - Using Constants and Literals
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_SPEED 120    // Constant

int main() {
    int speed = MAX_SPEED;   // Using constant
    char letter = 'A';       // Character literal

    printf("Max Speed: %d km/h\n", speed); // Output constant value
    printf("Letter: %c\n", letter);        // Output character literal

    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```bash
Max Speed: 120 km/h
Letter: A
```

## Conclusion

Constants and literals in C are crucial for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code. Constants, whether defined with `#define` or using the `const` keyword, provide fixed values that remain unchanged throughout the program, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of accidental modification. Literals, on the other hand, are the actual data values used directly in the program (such as numbers, characters, and strings).

By utilizing constants and literals effectively, you can:

- **Enhance code clarity** by giving meaningful names to fixed values.
- **Prevent errors** by avoiding accidental changes to critical values.
- **Improve maintainability** as changes need only be made in one place (e.g., changing the value of a constant).

Understanding and applying constants and literals properly is key to writing efficient, readable, and maintainable C programs.
