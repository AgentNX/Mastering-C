# Basic Syntax

The syntax of C is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols and keywords that form valid C programs. A solid understanding of this foundational syntax is critical for writing correct and readable C code.

## 1. Structure of a C Program

- A C program consists of functions and declarations, with `main()` as the entry point.
- The general structure includes:
```bash
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive for standard I/O functions

int main() {        // Main function where execution begins
    // Code statements
    return 0;       // Return statement for program termination
}
```
## 2. Key Components of C Syntax

- **Tokens**: The smallest elements in C, including keywords, identifiers, constants, strings, and operators.
- **Semicolon (;)**: Used to terminate statements. Every statement in C must end with a semicolon.
- **Case Sensitivity**: C is case-sensitive, so `int` and `Int` are treated as different identifiers.
- **Curly Braces {}**: Used to group statements, defining the scope of code blocks such as functions, loops, or conditional structures.

## 3. Data Types and Variable Declarations

- A C program requires declaring variables with specific data types like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
```bash
int age = 25;        // Integer variable
float height = 5.9;  // Floating-point variable
char grade = 'A';    // Character variable
```
- Variables are typically declared at the beginning of a function, although they can be declared within any block.

## 4. Comments

- Comments are non-executable text used for documentation, ignored by the compiler.
	- **Single-line comments**: Begin with `//`.
	```bash
 	// This is a single-line comment
 	```
 	- **Multi-line comments**: Enclosed in `/* */`.
    ```bash
	/*
 	* This is a
 	* multi-line comment
 	*/
    ```
## 5. Basic Input and Output Functions

- The `printf()` and `scanf()` functions from `stdio.h` are used for output and input, respectively.
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");  // Output
    scanf("%d", &number);        // Input
    printf("You entered: %d\n", number);
    return 0;
}
```

## 6. Identifiers and Keywords

- **Identifiers**: Names given to variables, functions, and other user-defined items. They must start with a letter or underscore and are case-sensitive.
```bash
int myVariable;
```
- **Keywords**: Reserved words in C (e.g., `int`, `return`, `for`, `if`, `while`). They have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.

## 7. Operators

- Basic operators include arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), relational (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and assignment (`=`).
