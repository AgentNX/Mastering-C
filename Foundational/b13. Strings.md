# Strings

In C, a **string** is an array of characters terminated by a special character `\0` (null character). The null terminator signals the end of the string, allowing functions to determine its length. Unlike languages with built-in string data types, C treats strings simply as character arrays.

## 1. Declaring and Initializing Strings

Strings can be declared and initialized in several ways:

- **Character Array**:
```bash
char str[6] = "Hello";  // Includes the null terminator, total size is 6
```
- **Direct Initialization**:
```bash
char str[] = "Hello";  // Compiler automatically sizes the array (6 elements with null terminator)
```
- **Character-by-Character**:
```bash
char str[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
```

## 2. String Input and Output

The `printf` and `scanf` functions are commonly used for working with strings:

- `printf` can print strings directly with the `%s` format specifier:
```bash
printf("%s\n", str);  // Output: Hello
```
- `scanf` can read a string from standard input until whitespace or a newline:
```bash
char name[50];
printf("Enter your name: ");
scanf("%s", name);  // Reads a single word
```
- For multi-word input, use `fgets`:
```bash
printf("Enter a sentence: ");
fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);  // Reads until newline or buffer is full
```

## 3. String Library Functions

The `<string.h>` library provides functions for common string operations.

- `strlen`: Get the length of a string (excluding the null terminator).
```bash
int length = strlen(str);
```
- `strcpy`: Copy one string to another.
```bash
char dest[20];
strcpy(dest, str);  // Copies contents of str to dest
```
- `strcat`: Concatenate two strings.
```bash
strcat(dest, str);  // Appends str to dest
```
- `strcmp`: Compare two strings (returns 0 if equal, a positive/negative value otherwise).
```bash
if (strcmp(str1, str2) == 0) {
    printf("Strings are equal.\n");
}
```

## 4. Common Operations with Strings

- **Finding Length**: `strlen` calculates the number of characters before the null terminator.
- **Copying**: `strcpy` copies the contents of one string into another.
- **Concatenation**: `strcat` appends one string to the end of another.
- **Comparison**: `strcmp` compares two strings lexicographically.

## 5. Manipulating Strings with Loops

Since a string is a character array, you can use loops to manually manipulate characters.

### Example (Convert to Uppercase)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void to_uppercase(char str[]) {
    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        str[i] = toupper(str[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "hello";
    to_uppercase(str);
    printf("%s\n", str);  // Output: HELLO
    return 0;
}
```

## 6. String Limitations in C

- **Fixed Size**: String arrays need a fixed size, which can lead to inefficiency or overflow issues if not managed carefully.
- **No Built-in String Type**: C treats strings as character arrays, making string manipulation more manual.
- **No Bounds Checking**: C doesnâ€™t check array bounds, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## 7. Pointers and Strings

Since strings are arrays, pointers can be used to manipulate them more flexibly.

### Example
```bash
char *str = "Hello";
printf("%c\n", *(str + 1));  // Accesses second character 'e'
```
