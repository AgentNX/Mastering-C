# `goto` Statement

The `goto` statement in C provides a way to transfer control to another part of the program using labels. While it can make code execution jump directly to a labeled statement, its use is generally discouraged as it can lead to unreadable and unstructured code (often called "spaghetti code").

## Syntax
```bash
goto label;
// Some code here
label:
// Code to execute after the label
```

`label`: An identifier followed by a colon `:` that marks the destination of the `goto` statement.

## Example 1: Basic Usage
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Start of the program.\n");

    goto skip;  // Jump to the label 'skip'

    printf("This line will be skipped.\n");

    skip:
    printf("This line is executed after the jump.\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```bash
Start of the program.
This line is executed after the jump.
```

## Example 2: Exiting Nested Loops

The `goto` statement can simplify the logic of breaking out of nested loops.
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (i == 1 && j == 1) {
                goto exit;  // Exit all loops
            }
            printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
        }
    }

    exit:
    printf("Exited nested loops.\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```bash
i = 0, j = 0
i = 0, j = 1
i = 0, j = 2
i = 1, j = 0
Exited nested loops.
```

## When to Use `goto`

While `goto` is not commonly used in modern programming, it can be useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Breaking out of deeply nested loops**:
  - Instead of using multiple `break` statements or complex flags, `goto` provides a straightforward exit path.
2. **Error Handling**:
  - In older C programs, `goto` is sometimes used for error cleanup when multiple resources need to be freed.

### Example: Error Handling with `goto`
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (!file) {
        goto error;  // Jump to error handling
    }

    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(100);
    if (!buffer) {
        fclose(file);
        goto error;
    }

    printf("File opened and memory allocated.\n");

    free(buffer);
    fclose(file);
    return 0;

    error:
    printf("An error occurred.\n");
    return -1;
}
```

## Why Avoid `goto`?

- **Poor Readability**: Jumping around the code makes it harder to follow the program logic.
- **Maintenance Issues**: Spaghetti code created by excessive use of `goto` is difficult to debug and maintain.
- **Modern Alternatives**: Structured programming constructs (`if-else`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `return`) provide cleaner and more predictable flow control.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Labels Judiciously**:
  - Choose meaningful labels for readability.
  ```bash
  error_cleanup:
  ```

2. **Prefer Structured Constructs**:
  - For most scenarios, use structured loops and conditional statements instead of `goto`.

3. **Restrict Usage**:
  - Only use `goto` when it significantly simplifies error handling or control flow.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- | 
| Simplifies exiting nested loops.	| Can make code harder to read. |
| Useful for error handling.	| Encourages unstructured programming. | 
| Explicit jump in program flow.	| Modern constructs often eliminate the need for `goto`. |
