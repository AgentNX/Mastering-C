# Conditional (Ternary) Operators

The **conditional operator** (also known as the **ternary operator**) is a concise way to perform a conditional check and execute one of two expressions based on a condition. Itâ€™s the only ternary operator in C, meaning it takes three operands.

## Syntax
```bash
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
- `condition`: An expression that evaluates to `true` (non-zero) or `false` (zero).
- `expression1`: Executed if `condition` is true.
- `expression2`: Executed if `condition` is false.

## Example

### 1. Basic Usage
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    printf("The maximum value is %d.\n", max);
    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
The maximum value is 20.
```

- If `a > b` is `true`, the value of `a` is assigned to `max`.
- If `a > b` is `false`, the value of `b` is assigned to `max`.

## Advanced Examples

### 2. Nested Conditional Operators
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20, c = 15;
    int max = (a > b) ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c);

    printf("The maximum value is %d.\n", max);
    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
The maximum value is 20.
```

- The condition checks `a > b`.
  - If `true`, it checks `a > c` and assigns `a` or `c`.
  - If `false`, it checks `b > c` and assigns `b` or `c`.
 
### 3. Inline Conditional Assignments
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int score = 75;
    char *grade = (score >= 50) ? "Pass" : "Fail";

    printf("Your grade is: %s.\n", grade);
    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
Your grade is: Pass.
```

### 4. Using Conditional Operator in Function Arguments
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

void printMessage(int condition) {
    printf("%s\n", condition ? "Condition is true" : "Condition is false");
}

int main() {
    int isValid = 1;
    printMessage(isValid);
    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
Condition is true
```

## Key Points

1. **Compact Syntax**: The ternary operator condenses an `if-else` structure into a single line of code.
```bash
if (condition) {
    result = expression1;
} else {
    result = expression2;
}
// Equivalent to:
result = condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

2. **Readability**:
- Use the conditional operator for simple conditions.
- Avoid deeply nested conditional operators, as they can reduce code readability.
3. **Type Compatibility**:
- Both `expression1` and `expression2` must evaluate to the same or compatible types for the ternary operator to work properly.
4. **Use in Assignments**:
- It is commonly used for initializing or assigning values conditionally, as seen in the examples above.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Side Effects**: Avoid using ternary operators with side-effect-producing statements (e.g., increment or function calls).
```bash
// Avoid this:
(a > b) ? func1() : func2();
```
2. **Overuse**:
- Use it judiciously; overly complex ternary expressions can make code difficult to read.
3. **Ambiguity**: Parentheses are not required but are often used to improve clarity:
```bash
int result = (a > b) ? (a + b) : (a - b); // Clearer
```

## Comparison with `if-else`

|Feature	| Conditional Operator	| if-else|
|---------| ----------- | -------|
|Syntax	| Single line	| Multi-line|
|Readability	| Clear for simple cases	| Better for complex logic|
|Performance	| Similar (depends on compiler optimization)	| Similar|
|Usage	| Inline assignments or simple checks	| Complex conditional logic|
