# Expressions

An expression in C is a combination of variables, constants, operators, and functions that are evaluated to produce a value. Expressions are fundamental to C programming, allowing computations, assignments, and logical operations to be executed. They can be simple or complex, depending on the operations they perform.

## 1. Types of Expressions

- **Constant Expression**: Contains only constants and evaluates to a fixed value.
```bash
int x = 5 + 10;  // 15 is a constant expression
```
- **Arithmetic Expression**: Combines variables, constants, and arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
```bash
int sum = a + b * c - d / e;
```
- **Relational Expression**: Compares values using relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`). Results in `true` (1) or `false` (0).
```bash
if (a > b) {
    printf("a is greater than b");
}
```
- **Logical Expression**: Combines expressions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`). Often used in conditional statements.
```bash
if (a > b && c < d) {
    printf("Both conditions are true");
}
```
- **Bitwise Expression**: Involves bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) and works on individual bits.
```bash
int result = a & b;
```
- **Assignment Expression**: Assigns a value to a variable using `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
```bash
x = 10;
y += 5;
```
- **Conditional (Ternary) Expression**: A shorthand for `if-else` that uses the `? :` operator.
```bash
int result = (a > b) ? a : b;  // result is a if a > b, otherwise it's b
```
- **Pointer Expression**: Uses pointers and operators like `*` (dereference) and `&` (address).
```bash
int *ptr = &x;
int value = *ptr;  // value now holds the value of x
```

## 2. Evaluation of Expressions

- **Precedence and Associativity**: Operators have precedence that determines the order in which they are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. Associativity defines the direction in which operators with the same precedence level are processed (usually left-to-right).
- Examples of Precedence:
	- Multiplication and division (`*`, `/`) have higher precedence than addition and subtraction (`+`, `-`).
	- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`) have the lowest precedence.
- Example:
```bash
int result = 10 + 5 * 2;  // result is 20, as multiplication has higher precedence than addition
```

## 3. Complex Expressions

- Complex expressions can include multiple types of operators, variables, and function calls. Using parentheses `()` can help clarify evaluation order and improve readability.
```bash
int result = (a + b) * (c - d) / e;
```
## 4. Side Effects in Expressions

- Some expressions cause side effects, meaning they change the state of the program beyond just producing a value.
- Examples of side effects:
	- **Assignment**: x = y + 10;
	- **Increment/Decrement**: x++;
	- **Function Calls**: If the function modifies global or external variables.

## 5. Common Expression Pitfalls

- **Unintended Operator Precedence**: Misunderstanding precedence can lead to unexpected results.
- **Floating-point Division Errors**: Integer division may yield unintended results when not handled properly.
- **Use of Uninitialized Variables**: Expressions using uninitialized variables may yield unpredictable results.
