# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators, also known as relational operators, are used to compare two values. These operators return either `1` (true) if the condition is satisfied or `0` (false) if it is not.

## List of Comparison Operators

| Operator	| Name	| Description	| Example	| Result |
|----------| -------| ----------- | -------- | ----- | 
| `==` | Equal to	| Checks if two values are equal.	| `5 == 5`	| true |
|`!=`	| Not equal to	| Checks if two values are not equal.	| `5 != 3`	| true|
|`<`	| Less than	| Checks if the left value is smaller than the right.	| `3 < 5`	| true|
|`>`	| Greater than	| Checks if the left value is greater than the right.	| `5 > 3`	| true|
|`<=`	| Less than or equal to	| Checks if the left value is smaller than or equal to the right.	| `3 <= 3`	| true|
|`>=`	| Greater than or equal to	| Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.	| `5 >= 5`	| true|

## Examples of Each Operator

### 1. Equal to (`==`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 5;

    if (a == b) {
        printf("a is equal to b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is not equal to b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is equal to b.
```

### 2. Not Equal to (`!=`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3;

    if (a != b) {
        printf("a is not equal to b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is equal to b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is not equal to b.
```

### 3. Less Than (`<`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 3, b = 5;

    if (a < b) {
        printf("a is less than b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is not less than b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is less than b.
```

### 4. Greater Than (`>`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3;

    if (a > b) {
        printf("a is greater than b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is not greater than b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is greater than b.
```

### 5. Less Than or Equal to (`<=`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 5;

    if (a <= b) {
        printf("a is less than or equal to b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is not less than or equal to b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is less than or equal to b.
```

### 6. Greater Than or Equal to (`>=`)
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 3;

    if (a >= b) {
        printf("a is greater than or equal to b.\n");
    } else {
        printf("a is not greater than or equal to b.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```bash
a is greater than or equal to b.
```

## Use Cases

1. **Conditional Statements**: Comparison operators are often used in `if`, `while`, and `for` statements to make decisions or repeat actions.
```bash
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You are eligible to vote.\n");
}
```
2. **Sorting Algorithms**: They are used to compare values during sorting operations (e.g., bubble sort, quick sort).
3. **Validating Input**: Validate user input against certain conditions.
```bash
if (score >= 0 && score <= 100) {
    printf("Valid score.\n");
}
```
