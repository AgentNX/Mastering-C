# Data Types

Data types in C define the type of data a variable can hold. Choosing the correct data type ensures efficient memory usage and accurate data representation.

## 1. Primitive Data Types

- **int (Integer)**:
	- Used for whole numbers.
	- **Size**: Typically 4 bytes (can vary based on system).
	- **Range**: Usually __-2,147,483,648__ to __2,147,483,647__ for a 4-byte `int`.  
   
	```bash
 	int age = 25;
	```
 
- **float (Floating-point)**:
	- Used for single-precision decimal values.
	- **Size**: Typically 4 bytes.
	- **Range**: Approximately __±3.4e-38__ to __±3.4e+38__.  
   
   	```bash
    float price = 19.99;
	```
    
- **double (Double precision floating-point)**:
	- Used for double-precision decimal values.
	- **Size**: Typically 8 bytes.
	- **Range**: Approximately __±1.7e-308__ to __±1.7e+308__.  
   
	```bash
 	double pi = 3.14159;
	```
 
- **char (Character)**:
	- Used for storing single characters.
	- **Size**: 1 byte.
	- **Range**: __-128__ to __127__ (or 0 to 255 for unsigned).  
   
	```bash
 	char initial = 'A';
	```
 
## 2. Derived Data Types

- **Array**:
	- A collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory.  
   
   	```bash
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	```
    
- **Pointer**:
	- Holds the address of another variable.  
   
   	```bash
	int x = 10;
	int *ptr = &x;
    ```
    
- **Structure**:
	- A user-defined data type that groups variables of different types.  
   
   	```bash
    struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
	};
	```
    
- **Union**:
	- Similar to a structure, but shares memory among its members, saving space.  
   
   	```bash
	union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
	};
    ```

## 3. Enumerated Type (`enum`)

Used to define named integer constants, improving code readability.    

```bash
enum day {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY};
enum day today = MONDAY;
```

## 4. Void Type

- **void**: Represents an empty type.
	- Used for functions that do not return a value.
	- Also used for generic pointers (`void *`), allowing pointers to hold any data type.

## 5. Modifiers

- **short, long, signed, unsigned**:
	- Modify data types to alter the range and size of values.  
   
   	```bash
	unsigned int count = 100;
	long double bigNumber = 1.0e+10;
    ```
    
## 6. Summary Table

| Data Type | Size (bytes) | Range |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
|int		|4 bytes	   |-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
|char		|1 bytes	   |-128 to 127 (signed)|
|float		|4 bytes	   |±3.4e-38 to ±3.4e+38|
|double		|8 bytes	   |±1.7e-308 to ±1.7e+308|
|short int	|2 bytes	   |-32,768 to 32,767|
|long int	|8 bytes	   |-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|unsigned	|Depends on Base Type |0 to positive range|
