# Variables and Constants

In C, **variables** and **constants** are fundamental for storing data in memory, each serving a different purpose in managing and maintaining values.

## 1. Variables

- A variable is a named storage location in memory that can hold a value, which can be modified during program execution.
- Each variable has a specific data type (like `int`, `float`, `char`), which defines the kind of data it can hold and how much memory it occupies.

### Declaration and Initialization:

- Variables must be declared before use, specifying the data type and identifier (name).
- Declaration syntax:
```bash
int age;          // Declaration
age = 25;         // Initialization
int age = 25;     // Combined declaration and initialization
```
- **Scope**: Determines the part of the program where the variable can be accessed. C supports **block scope** (variables are limited to the block `{}` in which they are defined).
- **Lifetime**: Refers to the duration a variable exists in memory. For instance, local variables exist only during function execution.

### Variable Types:

- **Local Variables**: Defined inside a function and only accessible within that function.
- **Global Variables**: Declared outside of all functions, accessible from any function in the same file.
- **Static Variables**: Retain their value between function calls if declared within a function. Global static variables restrict access to within the file.
- **Register Variables**: Stored in CPU registers instead of RAM for faster access (often used for counters).

## 2. Constants

- **Constants** (or literals) represent fixed values that do not change during the programâ€™s execution.
- There are different ways to define constants in C, depending on the type and usage.

### Types of Constants:

- **Integer Constants**: Whole numbers without a fractional part.
```bash
const int MAX_AGE = 100;
```
- **Floating-point Constants**: Numbers with a decimal or exponential part.
```bash
const float PI = 3.14;
```
- **Character Constants**: Represent single characters, enclosed in single quotes.
```bash
const char GRADE = 'A';
```
- **String Constants**: Represent text enclosed in double quotes (not technically constants, but immutable).
```bash
const char *welcome = "Hello, World!";
```

### Constant Definition Methods:

- `#define` Preprocessor Directive:
	- Creates a macro for constant values, making code easier to modify.
   	```bash
    #define PI 3.14159
	```
- `const` Keyword:
  	- Declares variables as read-only, ensuring the value cannot be modified after initialization.
  	```bash
    const int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
    ```

## 3. Example of Variables and Constants in Action

```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX 100         // Preprocessor constant

int main() {
    const float PI = 3.14;  // Constant with 'const'
    int radius = 5;         // Variable
    float area;

    area = PI * radius * radius;
    printf("The area is: %.2f\n", area);

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Why Use Constants?

- **Code Readability**: Constants make code easier to understand.
- **Prevent Unintended Changes**: Values marked `const` or defined with `#define` prevent accidental modification.
- **Maintainability**: Allows easy updates by changing values in a single location.
