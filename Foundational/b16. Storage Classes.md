# Storage Classes

In C, **storage classes** define the scope, lifetime, visibility, and default initial value of variables or functions. They determine where and how memory is allocated and accessed. C supports four primary storage classes.

## 1. Automatic (`auto`)

- **Scope**: Local to the block or function in which the variable is defined.
- **Lifetime**: Exists only during the execution of the block or function.
- **Default Initial Value**: Undefined (garbage value).
- **Storage Location**: Stored in stack memory.

By default, all local variables in a block or function are `auto`, so explicitly specifying `auto` is rarely needed.

### Syntax
```bash
auto int x;
```

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
void demo() {
    auto int a = 10; // Equivalent to "int a = 10;"
    printf("Value: %d\n", a);
}
```

## 2. Static (`static`)

- **Scope**:
  - **For variables**: Local to the block or function in which it's defined.
  - **For global variables**: Accessible throughout the file.
- **Lifetime**: Exists for the entire duration of the program (retains value between function calls).
- **Default Initial Value**:
  - `0` for numeric types.
  - `NULL` for pointers.
- **Storage Location**: Stored in global/static memory.

A `static` variable within a function retains its value between multiple calls to that function.

### Syntax
```bash
static int x;
```

### Example (Retaining value between calls):
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

void counter() {
    static int count = 0; // Retains its value between function calls
    count++;
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
}

int main() {
    counter(); // Output: Count: 1
    counter(); // Output: Count: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Example (Static global variable - limited to the file):
```bash
static int shared = 42;  // Accessible only in this file
```

## 3. External (`extern`)

- **Scope**: Global (accessible across multiple files).
- **Lifetime**: Exists for the entire duration of the program.
- **Default Initial Value**:
  - `0` for numeric types.
  - `NULL` for pointers.
- **Storage Location**: Stored in global memory.

The `extern` keyword is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another file. It allows sharing variables/functions between multiple files in a program.

### Syntax
```bash
extern int x;
```

### Example: File 1 (`file1.c`):
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int shared = 42; // Global variable defined here
```

### Example: File 2 (`file2.c`):
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

extern int shared; // Declared here to use the global variable
void display() {
    printf("Shared: %d\n", shared);
}
```

## 4. Register (`register`)

- **Scope**: Local to the block or function in which the variable is defined.
- **Lifetime**: Exists only during the execution of the block or function.
- **Default Initial Value**: Undefined (garbage value).
- **Storage Location**: Attempted to store in CPU registers for faster access.

The `register` keyword suggests that the variable should be stored in a CPU register rather than memory, for speed. However, this is only a suggestion, and the compiler may ignore it.

### Syntax
```bash
register int x;
```

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

void fast_increment() {
    register int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
        // Fast access loop counter
    }
    printf("Loop finished.\n");
}
```

## Comparison Table

| Storage Class	| Scope	| Lifetime | Default Value | Storage Location |
| `auto`	| Block/function | Block/function execution	| Undefined	| Stack memory |
| `static`	| Block (local) or file	| Entire program duration	| 0 / NULL	| Global/static memory |
| `extern`	| Global (across files)	| Entire program duration	| 0 / NULL	| Global memory | 
| `register`	| Block/function | Block/function execution |	Undefined	| CPU register (if possible) |
