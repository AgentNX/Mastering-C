# Input & Output Functions

C provides standard functions to handle input and output, with `printf` used for output and `scanf` for input. These functions are part of the standard library (`<stdio.h>`) and are commonly used to interact with users.

## 1. `printf` (Output Function)

The `printf` function prints formatted text to the standard output (typically the screen). It allows displaying strings, numbers, characters, and other data.

### Syntax
```bash
int printf(const char *format, ...);
```
  - `format`: A format string that includes text and format specifiers.
  - `...`: Additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers.

### Common Format Specifiers

  - `%d` or `%i`: Integer (decimal)
  - `%f`: Floating-point number
  - `%c`: Single character
  - `%s`: String of characters
  - `%x` / `%X`: Hexadecimal (lowercase / uppercase)
  - `%o`: Octal

### Example
```bash
int age = 25;
printf("I am %d years old.\n", age);  // Outputs: I am 25 years old.
```
### Explanation

  - `%d` is replaced by the value of `age`.
  - `\n` is a newline character to move to the next line.

### Additional `printf` Features

  - Width and Precision: Controls field width and number of decimal places for floats.
  ```bash
  printf("%6d", 42);        // Prints "    42" (right-aligned, width 6)
  printf("%.2f", 3.14159);  // Prints "3.14" (two decimal places)
  ```

## 2. `scanf` (Input Function)

The `scanf` function reads formatted input from the standard input (typically the keyboard). It expects a format string and pointers to variables where the input values will be stored.

### Syntax
```bash
int scanf(const char *format, ...);
```
  - `format`: A format string that includes format specifiers.
  - `...`: Arguments (addresses of variables) where the input will be stored.

### Example
```bash
int age;
printf("Enter your age: ");
scanf("%d", &age);
printf("Your age is %d\n", age);
```

### Explanation

  - `%d` expects an integer input, which is stored in `age`.
  - `&age` is a pointer to `age` (using `&` to pass the variable's address).

### Common Format Specifiers for `scanf`

  - `%d` or `%i`: Integer (decimal)
  - `%f`: Floating-point number
  - `%c`: Single character
  - `%s`: String of characters (stops reading at whitespace)
  - `%lf`: Double (floating-point)

### Important Points with `scanf`

  - **Address Operator (`&`)**: Passes the address of the variable where the input will be stored. This is necessary for most types except strings.
  ```bash
  int num;
  scanf("%d", &num);  // Correct
  ```
  - **Whitespace in Input**: `%s` stops reading at whitespace, so `scanf` will only read the first word if you enter a sentence.

## 3. Combining `printf` and `scanf` for I/O

Together, `printf` and `scanf` enable basic user interaction in a C program.

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    float height;

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.75): ");
    scanf("%f", &height);

    printf("You are %d years old and %.2f meters tall.\n", age, height);

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Common Issues with `printf` and `scanf`

- **Newline Buffer Issue**: After reading a `char` or `string` input, a newline may be left in the input buffer, which can interfere with subsequent `scanf` calls.
- **Buffer Overflow**: `scanf` does not limit input length, so `%s` may lead to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the variable size.
