# Preprocessor Directives

In C, **preprocessor directives** are commands that are processed by the C preprocessor before the actual compilation of the program begins. These directives control how the code is compiled, enabling functionality like macro definitions, file inclusion, conditional compilation, and more. Preprocessor directives start with the `#` symbol and are not terminated with a semicolon.

## Types of Preprocessor Directives

## 1. File Inclusion (`#include`)

Used to include the contents of another file (usually header files) into the program.

### Syntax
```bash
#include <header_file>
#include "custom_file.h"
```

- `<header_file>`: Searches for the file in the standard system directories (e.g., stdio.h).
- `"custom_file.h"`: Searches for the file in the current directory first, then in the system directories.

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myheader.h"
```

## 2. Macro Definition (`#define`)

Used to define macros, which are constants or small functions that can replace text in the code.

### Syntax
```bash
#define MACRO_NAME value_or_code
```

- **Object-like Macros**: Replace a name with a value.
```bash
#define PI 3.14
printf("Value of PI: %f\n", PI);  // Output: 3.14
```

- **Function-like Macros**: Define reusable code snippets that take arguments.
```bash
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
printf("Square of 5: %d\n", SQUARE(5));  // Output: 25
```

## 3. Conditional Compilation (`#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif`)

Used to compile code conditionally based on certain conditions or macro definitions.

- `#if`: Checks a condition.
- `#ifdef`: Checks if a macro is defined.
- `#ifndef`: Checks if a macro is not defined.
- `#else`: Specifies alternative code if the condition is false.
- `#elif`: Adds another condition.
- `#endif`: Ends the conditional directive.

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#define DEBUG

int main() {
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is ON.\n");
#else
    printf("Debug mode is OFF.\n");
#endif
    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Undefining Macros (`#undef`)

Used to remove a previously defined macro.

### Syntax
```bash
#undef MACRO_NAME
```

### Example
```bash
#define PI 3.14
#undef PI
#define PI 3.14159  // Redefines PI
```

## 5. Line Control (`#line`)

Used to change the current line number and filename in the compiler's output. This is useful for debugging and error reporting.

### Syntax
```bash
#line line_number "filename"
```

### Example
```bash
#line 100 "example.c"
printf("This is line 100 in file example.c\n");
```

## 6. Error Directive (`#error`)

Used to stop compilation and display an error message.

### Syntax
```bash
#error "Error message"
```

### Example
```bash
#ifndef PI
#error "PI is not defined."
#endif
```

## 7. Pragma Directives (`#pragma`)

Provide special instructions to the compiler. Pragmas are compiler-specific and may not be portable.

### Common Pragmas

- **`#pragma` once**: Ensures the file is included only once.
```bash
#pragma once
```

- **`#pragma warning`**: Controls warnings (compiler-specific).
```bash
#pragma warning(disable : 4996)  // Disable a specific warning
```

## Comparison Table

| Directive	| Purpose |
| #include| Includes header or custom files into the program. | 
| #define | Defines macros for constants or reusable code. | 
| #undef | Undefines a macro. | 
| #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, #endif | Conditional compilation. | 
| #line	| Changes line numbers and filenames for debugging. | 
| #error | Outputs an error message and stops compilation. | 
| #pragma | Compiler-specific instructions (e.g., #pragma once). | 

## Advantages of Preprocessor Directives

- Enable code reuse and modularity through file inclusion.
- Simplify code with macros.
- Provide flexibility with conditional compilation.
- Improve debugging and compiler behavior with custom directives.
