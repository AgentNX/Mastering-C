# Arguments By Value

In C, arguments by value means that when a function is called, each argument's value is copied and passed to the function. The function receives only a copy of the original value, so any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. This method is also known as pass-by-value.

## 1. How Arguments by Value Work

When an argument is passed by value:

- A copy of the actual argument's value is made and stored in the function’s parameter.
- Modifications to the parameter inside the function do not impact the original variable, as only the copy is modified.
- Here, `num` is passed by value to the `modify` function.
- The function changes `x` to `10`, but since `x` is a copy, `num` in `main` remains unchanged.

### Example
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

void modify(int x) {
    x = 10;  // Modifies the copy of x, not the original variable
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Before: %d\n", num);  // Output: Before: 5
    modify(num);
    printf("After: %d\n", num);   // Output: After: 5 (unchanged)
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Characteristics of Passing Arguments by Value

- **Isolation**: Changes to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.
- **Safety**: The original data remains intact and protected from unintended modifications.
- **No Side Effects**: Since functions cannot modify the caller's variables, pass-by-value is useful when you want to avoid side effects.

## 3. Examples of Arguments by Value with Different Data Types

- **Integers and Floating-Point Numbers**: Simple data types like int and float are passed by value, meaning changes inside the function do not affect the original variable.
```bash
void add_one(int n) {
    n = n + 1;
}
```
- **Arrays**: Arrays in C behave differently. When passing an array, the function receives a pointer to the original data rather than a copy, so modifications within the function can change the original array.
- **Structures**: Structs can be passed by value, meaning a full copy of the struct is made. This can be inefficient for large structs, so often structs are passed by reference (using pointers) instead.

## 4. Advantages of Passing by Value

- **Data Integrity**: Original variables remain unaltered by the function, reducing the risk of unintended changes.
- **Simplicity**: Helps in cases where data should be used without modification, such as in mathematical calculations or read-only operations.

## 5. Limitations of Passing by Value

- **Memory Overhead**: Creating copies for large data types, like structs, can be memory-intensive and slow.
- **Lack of Modifiability**: If you need to modify the original data, passing by value won’t work, and you’ll need to use pointers (pass-by-reference).
