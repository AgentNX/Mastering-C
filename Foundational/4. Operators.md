# Operators

Operators are symbols in C that perform operations on variables and values. They are fundamental to manipulating data and creating expressions in C programs. Here’s a comprehensive look at the types of operators and their uses in C.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

- Used for basic mathematical operations.
- **Operators**: `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division), `%` (Modulus - remainder of division).
- Example:
```bash
int a = 10, b = 3;
int sum = a + b;      // 13
int difference = a - b;  // 7
int product = a * b;   // 30
int quotient = a / b;  // 3
int remainder = a % b; // 1
```

## 2. Relational Operators

- Used to compare values. They return either `true` (non-zero) or `false` (0).
- **Operators**: `==` (Equal to), `!=` (Not equal to), `<` (Less than), `>` (Greater than), `<=` (Less than or equal to), `>=` (Greater than or equal to).
- Example:
```bash
int x = 5, y = 10;
if (x < y) {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
}
```

## 3. Logical Operators

- Used to combine conditional expressions.
- **Operators**: `&&` (Logical AND), `||` (Logical OR), `!` (Logical NOT).
- Example:
```bash
int a = 1, b = 0;
if (a && b) {
    printf("Both are true\n");
} else if (a || b) {
    printf("At least one is true\n");
}
```

## 4. Bitwise Operators

- Perform operations on individual bits of integers.
- **Operators**: `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (Left shift), `>>` (Right shift).
- Example:
```bash
int a = 5;   // 0101 in binary
int b = 9;   // 1001 in binary
int c = a & b;   // 0001 (1 in decimal)
int d = a | b;   // 1101 (13 in decimal)
```

## 5. Assignment Operators

- Used to assign values to variables.
- **Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`.
- Example:
```bash
int x = 10;
x += 5;    // Equivalent to x = x + 5, x becomes 15
```

## 6. Increment and Decrement Operators

- Used to increase or decrease a variable's value by 1.
- **Operators**: ++ (Increment), -- (Decrement).
- Example:
```bash
int x = 5;
x++;       // Now x is 6
int y = x--; // y is assigned 6, then x becomes 5
```

## 7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator

- A shorthand for `if-else` statements, `? :` is used to assign values based on a condition.
- **Syntax**: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`.
- Example:
```bash
int age = 18;
char *status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Kid";
```

## 8. Comma Operator

- Allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement. Only the last expression’s result is returned.
- Example:
```bash
int a = (1, 2, 3);  // a is assigned 3, the result of the last expression
```

## 9. Sizeof Operator

- Returns the size (in bytes) of a data type or variable.
- Example:
```bash
int x;
printf("%zu", sizeof(x));  // Prints the size of int, e.g., 4 bytes
```

## 10. Type Casting Operator

- Converts one data type to another explicitly.
- Example:
```bash
float f = 3.14;
int x = (int)f;  // x is now 3, as it truncates the decimal
```

## 11. Pointer Operators

- Used to work with memory addresses.
- **Operators**: `&` (Address of), `*` (Dereference).
- Example:
```bash
int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;  // ptr now holds the address of a
int value = *ptr; // value is now 5, the value of a
```
